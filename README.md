# Building Instructions

> While it's a recommended convention to name the directory containing build files as 'build', you have flexibility in choosing the name.

To initiate the build process, enter the following command:
```shell
cmake -B build
```

To generate an executable, execute the subsequent command:
```shell
cmake --build build
```

These commands will facilitate the build and executable creation process for your project.
